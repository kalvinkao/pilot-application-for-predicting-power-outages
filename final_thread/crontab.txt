To schedule a cron job:
- first, check the timezone you're in by entering "date" at the command line. (wasted a good amount of time at this part 
because I was going by my timezone)
- enter "crontab -e" at the command line
- enter the following:

# Haven't gotten this to work, but hope to so we can get hourly updates to check if it's working
MAILTO="joanna.huang@berkeley.edu" 

# Below cron job works- edit the MIN and HR accordingly
